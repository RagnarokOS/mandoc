# Mandoc

BSD manpage compiler toolset.

Mandoc is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro language of choice
for BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical language for UNIX
manuals. It is small, ISO C, ISC-licensed, and quite fast. The main component
of the toolset is the mandoc utility program, based on the libmandoc
validating compiler, to format output for UNIX terminals (with support for
wide-character locales), XHTML, HTML, PostScript, and PDF.

In Ragnarok, mandoc replaces man-db as the default way to handle manual pages.
